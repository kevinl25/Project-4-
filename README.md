  This web app will look at used car data and show a possible correlation between car brands that offer more 4wd options and a higher average sale price of their cars. 

  To do this, we will first group the listings by all cars with the same make, then by determine the average sale price of their models, and lastly calculate the percentage of their cars which are 4wd. We will then display the results in a scatter plot to show the possible correlation. We will also include a histogram to show the frequency of different price ranges to show the overall distribution of car prices.
